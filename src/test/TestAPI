Testing the API
Use a tool like Postman or cURL to test the endpoints:

Create Account: POST /api/accounts/create?accountNumber=12345&accountHolderName=John
Get Account: GET /api/accounts/12345
Deposit: POST /api/accounts/12345/deposit?amount=1000
Withdraw: POST /api/accounts/12345/withdraw?amount=500
This example demonstrates a simple REST API for a banking domain using Spring Boot. You can extend it further with additional functionality like transfer between accounts, transaction history, and more.
